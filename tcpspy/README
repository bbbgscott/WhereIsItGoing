README for tcpspy 1.7
---------------------

1. Introduction

tcpspy is an administrators' tool that logs selecting incoming and outgoing
TCP/IP connections. Please see the tcpspy(8) manual page for an extended
description; `man 8 tcpspy' after installation, or `man ./tcpspy.8' now.

2. Compilation and Installation Instructions

`make' to compile tcpspy, then `make install' to install it (to /usr/local
by default, change the Makefile if you need it installed elsewhere). Provided
you have the correct tools, `make doc' will convert the manual page to
HTML, PostScript and PDF formats: groff and ghostscript (ps2pdf).

3. Running tcpspy

Read the manual page. If you're not patient enough for that, type `tcpspy'
and see what happens.

4. Copyright, Licence, Warranty

See the file LICENCE for details.
