WhereIsItGoing
==============

WhereIsItGoing is a senior capstone project by CSUMB students Brian Scott and Scott Heinz that uses an older program, tcpspy, to read the state of current TCP connections.  Brian is working on building a Python application that will take the logged info from tcpspy, parse it, and add geolocation functionality.  Scott is working on upgrading tcpspy to include a myriad of new features such as IPv6 and SNMP support.
